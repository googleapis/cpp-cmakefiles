# Fedora includes packages for gRPC, libcurl, and OpenSSL that are recent enough
# for `google-cloud-cpp`. Install these packages and additional development
# tools to compile the dependencies:
RUN dnf makecache && \
    dnf install -y clang clang-tools-extra cmake doxygen findutils gcc-c++ git \
        grpc-devel grpc-plugins libcxx-devel libcxxabi-devel libcurl-devel \
        make openssl-devel pkgconfig protobuf-compiler python-pip ShellCheck \
        tar wget zlib-devel

# Install the the buildifier tool, which does not compile with the default
# golang compiler for Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04.
RUN wget -q -O /usr/bin/buildifier https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/releases/download/0.17.2/buildifier
RUN chmod 755 /usr/bin/buildifier

# Install cmake_format to automatically format the CMake list files.
#     https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format
# Pin this to an specific version because the formatting changes when the
# "latest" version is updated, and we do not want the builds to break just
# because some third party changed something.
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install numpy cmake_format==0.6.9
