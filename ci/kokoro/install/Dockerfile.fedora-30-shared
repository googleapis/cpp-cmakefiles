FROM fedora:30 AS devtools

# Please keep the formatting below, it is used by `extract-install.md`
# to generate the contents of the top-level INSTALL.md.

## [START INSTALL.md]

# Install the minimal development tools:

# ```bash
RUN dnf makecache && \
    dnf install -y cmake gcc-c++ git make openssl-devel pkgconfig \
        zlib-devel
# ```

# Fedora includes packages for gRPC, libcurl, and OpenSSL that are recent enough
# for `cpp-cmakefiles`. Install these packages and additional development
# tools to compile the dependencies:

# ```bash
RUN dnf makecache && \
    dnf install -y grpc-devel grpc-plugins \
        libcurl-devel protobuf-compiler tar wget zlib-devel
# ```

FROM devtools AS install

# #### googleapis

# We can now compile and install `googleapis` as shared library.

# ```bash
WORKDIR /home/build/cpp-cmakefiles
COPY . /home/build/cpp-cmakefiles
RUN cmake -H. -Bcmake-out -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=yes
RUN cmake --build cmake-out -- -j $(nproc)
WORKDIR /home/build/cpp-cmakefiles/cmake-out
RUN cmake --build . --target install
# The share libraries will install in `/usr/local/lib64` we need that directory
# in the ld.so cache:
RUN echo "/usr/local/lib64" | tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf
RUN ldconfig
# ```

## [END INSTALL.md]

# Verify that the installed files are actually usable
RUN /home/build/cpp-cmakefiles/ci/test-install/compile-test-projects.sh
